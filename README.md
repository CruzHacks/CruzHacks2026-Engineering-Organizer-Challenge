# CruzHacks2026 Organizer Challenge: Engineering Team

Thank you for showing interest in joining us for CruzHacks2026! We are excited to be potentially working with you, and seeing what you can bring to the organizing team.
* Please make sure to submit our Director/Organizer Application Form!
  * **Deadline for DIRECTOR applicants: May 30th, 11:59PM**
  *  Deadline for Organizer applicants: TBD

If you applied to Engineering Team, you will need to complete this supplemental challenge in addition to your application. We just want to see what experience you have regarding some of the technologies we will be using. This is an opportunity to show us what you know!

While reviewing applicants, remember that technical skills are only a portion of what we look for. We also value soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and dedication to the team. Don't worry if your supplemental application is not perfect - we will consider your application holistically.

# Instructions

Most of your responsibility on the eningeering team would be to maintain the website, and working closely with our Design and Logistics team to create a website that has a creative theme, and user friendly to our hackers! The first skill we are looking for is if our engineers can surface data into **JSX components while following a design mockup.**

You will be using ReactJS to complete this challenge.
Please follow the Figma Mockup ([Here](https://www.figma.com/design/SQ7Qmc7utSMpD0BwgafmGt/CruzHacks2026-Engineering-Challenge-Mockup?node-id=1-3&t=15nc3qwK7fNUuWOA-1)), to surface the data in `FAQdata.js`, provided in this repository in any method you wish.

Ensure your implementation utilizes reusable components rather than hardcoded values. Your solution should dynamically render content based on the provided JSON data. Any changes to the JSON—such as adding, removing, or modifying entries—should be accurately reflected in the UI without requiring changes to the code

You do not need to follow the Figma down to every little detail, feel free to add any modifications that you see fit. However please follow the design to the best of your ability.

# Evaluation

What we are looking for in your submission
* Fluency and Experience with JSX and CSS
* Ability to follow a design specification
* Modular and commented code - we will be working in a team, and it is important to us that you know how to write readable code in a collaborative repo.
* Reflection and thought - as part of your reflection submission, being able to communicate to us your thought process.

# Submission Materials

Please submit the following in a GitHub Repository:
* Your code. Any folders or additional ReactJS setup is allowed as well.
* README.MD: Simple instructions to run your project as well as directory path for main code files (so we know where to look). If no instructions are provided, your submission will not be evaluated
* Reflection.txt (or .md): A text file that answers the following questions
    * What technologies were used
    * What was the most challenging part of this task
    * What is something you wish to learn or improve upon when joining our CruzHacks team
 **PLEASE submit your supplemental by emailing dev@cruzhacks.com with the subject line: [FirstName] [LastName] - CruzHacks2026 Engineering Supplemental**
If you have any questions, please email contact@cruzhacks.com.
